## Plugins
It is possible to install plugins for HTML OS, even if its custom made.
All you need to do is add snippnets of code into the `htmlos-1.0.htm` file:

`````html
<div id="YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME"></div>
<script>
        fetch('data.xml') // Load XML file
            .then(response => response.text())
            .then(xmlString => {
                let parser = new DOMParser();
                let xmlDoc = parser.parseFromString(xmlString, "application/xml");
                let content = xmlDoc.querySelector("content").textContent;
                document.getElementById("xmlContent").innerHTML = content;
            })
            .catch(error => console.error("Error loading XML:", error));
</script>

`````
If the plugin comes with an overlay, add this:
`````css
        .overlay {
            position: fixed;
            top: 20%;
            left: 30%;
            background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
            color: white;
            padding: 20px;
        }
`````
Change the CSS file however you want, if you know what you are doing.
Replace `YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME` with your actual plugin name.

## How to make a plugin
To make a plugin all you need is an XML file, it should look like this:
````xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<data>
    <content>
        <![CDATA[
            <div class="overlay">
                <h2>Hello from XML!</h2>
                <p>This content is loaded dynamically.</p>
            </div>
        ]]>
    </content>
</data>

````
Feel free to edit the provided scripts to match your requirements.
If you plugin has an overlay, please remember to add an `overlay` class like this

````html
<div class="overlay"></div>
````
Please note that making a HTML OS plugin requires general HTML and XML knowledge.
